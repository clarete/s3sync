Welcome to s3cmd.rb
-------------------
This is a ruby program that wraps S3 operations into a simple command-line tool.
It is inspired by things like rsh3ll, #sh3ll, etc., but shares no code from
them. It's meant as a companion utility to s3sync.rb but could be used on its
own (provided you have read the other readme file and know how to use s3sync in
theory).

I made this even though lots of other "shell"s exist, because I wanted a
single-operation utility, instead of a shell "environment".  This lends itself
more to scripting, etc.  Also the delete operation on rsh3ll seems to be borken
at the moment? =(

Users not yet familiar with s3sync should read about that first, since s3cmd and
s3sync share a tremendous amount of conventions and syntax. Particularly you
have to set up environment variables prior to calling s3cmd, and s3cmd also uses
the "bucket:key" syntax popularized by s3sync. Many of the options are the same
too. Really, go read the other readme first if you haven't used s3sync yet.
Otherwise you will become confused.  It's OK, I'll wait.

....

In general, s3sync and s3cmd complement each other. s3sync is useful to perform
serious synchronization operations, and s3cmd allows you to do simple things
such as bucket management, listing, transferring single files, and the like.

Here is the usage, with examples to follow.

s3cmd.rb [options] <command> [arg(s)]           version 1.0.0
  --help    -h        --verbose     -v     --dryrun    -n
  --ssl     -s        --debug       -d

Commands:
s3cmd.rb  listbuckets  [headers]
s3cmd.rb  createbucket|deletebucket  <bucket>  [headers]
s3cmd.rb  list  <bucket>[:prefix]  [max/page]  [delimiter]  [headers]
s3cmd.rb  delete  <bucket>:key  [headers]
s3cmd.rb  deleteall  <bucket>[:prefix]  [headers]
s3cmd.rb  get|put  <bucket>:key  <file>  [headers]


A note about [headers]
----------------------
For some S3 operations, such as "put", you might want to specify certain headers
to the request such as Cache-Control, Expires, x-amz-acl, etc.  Rather than
supporting a load of separate command-line options for these, I just allow
header specification.  So to upload a file with public-read access you could
say:
	s3cmd.rb  put  MyBucket:TheFile.txt  x-amz-acl:public-read

If you don't need to add any particular headers then you can just ignore this
whole [headers] thing and pretend it's not there.  This is somewhat of an
advanced option.


Examples
--------
List all the buckets your account owns:
	s3cmd.rb listbuckets

Create a new bucket:
	s3cmd.rb createbucket BucketName

Create a new bucket in the EU:
	s3cmd.rb createbucket BucketName EU

Find out the location constraint of a bucket:
   s3cmd.rb location BucketName

Delete an old bucket you don't want any more:
	s3cmd.rb deletebucket BucketName

Find out what's in a bucket, 10 lines at a time:
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName 10

Only look in a particular prefix:
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName:startsWithThis

Look in the virtual "directory" named foo;
lists sub-"directories" and keys that are at this level.
Note that if you specify a delimiter you must specify a max before it.
(until I make the options parsing smarter)
	s3cmd.rb list BucketName:foo/  10  /

Delete a key:
	s3cmd.rb delete BucketName:AKey

Delete all keys that match (like a combo between list and delete):
	s3cmd.rb deleteall BucketName:SomePrefix

Only pretend you're going to delete all keys that match, but list them:
	s3cmd.rb  --dryrun  deleteall  BucketName:SomePrefix

Delete all keys in a bucket (leaving the bucket):
	s3cmd.rb deleteall BucketName

Get a file from S3 and store it to a local file
	s3cmd.rb get BucketName:TheFileOnS3.txt  ALocalFile.txt

Put a local file up to S3
Note we don't automatically set mime type, etc.
NOTE that the order of the options doesn't change. S3 stays first!
	s3cmd.rb put BucketName:TheFileOnS3.txt ALocalFile.txt
